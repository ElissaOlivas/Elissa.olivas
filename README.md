    <p> I am currently a Dealer Service Analyst for Ford Motor Credit. I help the Dealers and Ford Credit obtail new customers and help keep current ones all while making profits and reducing risks. I have been working with the company since 2016. I started out as a Discounter, moved to a discrepency specialist, then moved to Loss prevention working as a Skip Tracer and moved to my current position in 2021. </p>
    <p> I want to be a software engineer because of how creative you can be. Almost everything around us uses technology and the software engineer is the one that helps make it a possibility for the everyday person to experience it. I dont want to sit by while others create the future. I want to be the one that does the creating. </p>
